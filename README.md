Organizations and decision-makers often encounter difficulties in understanding and comparing household financial patterns across different demographic and geographic groups. Traditional spreadsheet-based methods can be time-consuming and fail to capture multi-dimensional insights, making it challenging to:

- Examine expenditure patterns by income quintile and demographic category.

This Tableau solution addresses these challenges by centralizing diverse datasets and presenting them through dynamic, interactive visualizations.
